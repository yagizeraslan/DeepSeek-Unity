---

## 🧰 Requirements

- Unity 2020.3 LTS or newer
- TextMeshPro (via Package Manager)
- DeepSeek API Key from [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/)

---

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Via Git URL (Unity Package Manager)

1. Open your Unity project
2. Go to **Window > Package Manager**
3. Click `+` → **Add package from Git URL**
4. Paste:
    
    ```csharp
    https://github.com/yagizeraslan/DeepSeek-Unity.git
    
    ```
    
5. Click **Add**

✅ Setup Wizard will guide you after install!

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Setup

1. After installation, the **Setup Wizard** will automatically open.
2. Paste your **API key** into the wizard window.
3. (Optional) Create a `DeepSeekSettings` asset inside the wizard for runtime-safe storage.
4. Drag the `DeepSeekChat` prefab from the sample into your scene.
5. Hit Play — and chat with DeepSeek AI in seconds 💬

---

## 🧪 Sample Scene

To test everything:

1. In **Package Manager**, under **DeepSeek API for Unity**, click **Samples**
2. Click **Import** on `DeepSeek Chat Example`
3. Open:
    
    ```csharp
    Assets/Samples/DeepSeek API for Unity/1.0.1/DeepSeek Chat Example/Scenes/DeepSeek-Chat.unity

    ```
    
4. Press Play — you're live.

🧠 **Runtime Adaptive:** You can change model type and streaming mode during play — the SDK picks up changes automatically for each new message.
- You can also press **Enter** instead of clicking Send button — handy for fast testing.

---

## 🔐 API Key Handling

- During dev: Store key via `EditorPrefs` using the DeepSeek Editor Window
- In production builds: Use the `DeepSeekSettings` ScriptableObject (recommended)

**DO NOT** hardcode your key in scripts or prefabs — Unity will reject the package.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

| Layer | Folder | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Logic | `Runtime/API/` | HTTP & model logic |
| Data Models | `Runtime/Data/` | DTOs for requests/responses |
| UI Component | `Runtime/UI/` | MonoBehaviour & Controller |
| Config Logic | `Runtime/Common/` | Secure key storage |
| Editor Tools | `Editor/` | Editor-only settings UI |
| Example Scene | `Samples~/` | Demo prefab, scene, assets |

---

## 🧩 Example Integration

```csharp
[SerializeField] private DeepSeekSettings config;

void Start()
{
    var api = new DeepSeekApi(config);
    var request = new ChatCompletionRequest
    {
        model = DeepSeekModel.DeepSeekChat.ToModelString(),
        messages = new List<ChatMessage>
        {
            new ChatMessage { role = "system", content = "You're a helpful assistant." },
            new ChatMessage { role = "user", content = "Tell me something cool." }
        }
    };

    var response = await api.CreateChatCompletion(request);
    Debug.Log(response.choices[0].message.content);
}

```

## 🛠 Advanced Usage

### 🔄 Streaming Support

DeepSeek-Unity supports **real-time streaming** using DeepSeek's official `stream: true` Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint.

✅ Uses Unity's `DownloadHandlerScript` for chunked response handling  
✅ UI updates per-token (no simulated typewriter effect)  
✅ No coroutines, no external libraries — works natively in Unity

To enable:
- Check `Use Streaming` in the chat prefab or component
- Partial responses will automatically stream into the UI

📌 You can toggle streaming on/off at runtime.

### 💬 Multiple Models

```csharp
DeepSeekModel.DeepSeek_V3
DeepSeekModel.DeepSeek_R1

```

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

**Can't add component?**

→ Make sure you dragged `DeepSeekSettings.asset` into the DeepSeekChat.cs's Config field.

**Streaming not working?**

→ Make sure you're on a platform that supports `DownloadHandlerScript` (Standalone or Editor).  
→ WebGL and iOS may have platform limitations for live SSE streams.

**Seeing JSON parse warnings in streaming mode?**  

→ These are normal during SSE — they occur when the parser receives partial chunks. They're automatically skipped and won't affect the final output.
